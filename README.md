## Getting Started

**Note**: Before you begin, make sure you have both Diggity and Docker installed on your system.

Start by pulling the container image for which you want to generate an SBOM. You can use the docker pull command to retrieve the image from a container registry. Replace `your-image:tag` with the actual image and tag you want to analyze.
```bash
docker pull your-image:tag
```

Diggity can now analyze your container image to identify its software components and generate an SBOM. Run the following command to perform the analysis:
```
diggity your-image:tag -o sbom.json
```
- `your-image:tag`: Replace this with the name and tag of the container image you pulled.
- `-o sbom.json`: This option specifies the output file for the generated SBOM. You can choose any file name and format you prefer.
<br />

Diggity will inspect the container image's filesystem and metadata to identify installed packages, libraries, and other dependencies.

## Scanning Tarball and Directory
Use the following command to analyze the contents of the Tar file:
```bash
diggity /path/to/your/file.tar -o sbom.json
```
- `/path/to/your/file.tar`: Replace this with the actual path to your Tar file.
<br />

Diggity will inspect the contents of the Tar file and identify software components and dependencies.


And, to analyze the contents of the directory:
```bash
diggity /path/to/your/directory -o sbom.json
```
- `/path/to/your/directory`: Replace this with the actual path to your directory.
<br />

Diggity will scan the directory's files and identify software components, libraries, and dependencies.

## Private Registry Authentication
### Local Docker Credentials
When a container image runtime is not present in the local machine, Diggity can pull images from private registries using the provided credentials in your diggity config or as a flag. (--regisytryURI, --registryUsername, (--registryPassword or --registryToken))

An example `.diggity.yaml` looks something like this:
```yaml
registry:
  uri: "https://index.docker.io"
  username: "docker_username"
  password: "docker_password"
  token: ""
```

### AWS ECR Credentials
To pull images from AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), provide your account credentials in your diggity config. 
The URI follows the `<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com` format, and the username would be  `AWS`. 
For the password, run the following command via AWS CLI to obtain your authentication token:

```
aws ecr get-login-password
```

Output:
```
<password>
```
Note that the authentication token is valid for 12 hours. 
For more information, check this [reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/get-login-password.html).

Your `.diggity.yaml` should look something like this:
```yaml
registry:
  uri: "<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com"
  username: "AWS"
  password: "<password>"
  token: ""
```
### Google Container Registry Credentials
To pull images from Google Container Registry, provide your account credentials in your diggity config. 
The URI follows the `gcr.io, us.gcr.io, eu.gcr.io, or asia.gcr.io` format depending on your service account, and the username would be  `oauth2accesstoken`. 
For the password, run the following command via Google CLI tool to obtain your authentication token:
```
gcloud auth print-access-token
```
Note that the authentication token is valid for about an hour only. 
For more information, check this [reference](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication).

Your `.diggity.yaml` should look something like this:
```yaml
registry:
  uri: "gcr.io"
  username: "oauth2accesstoken"
  password: "<token>"
  token: ""
```
### JFrog Container Registry Credentials
To pull images from JFrog Container Registry, provide your account credentials in your diggity config. 
The URI follows the `<server-name>.jfrog.io` format. 
For the password, run the following command in your terminal `docker login -u[username] [server-name].jfrog.io`:

Note that the authentication token is valid for about an hour only. 
For more information, check this [reference](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Getting+Started+with+Artifactory+as+a+Docker+Registry).

Your `.diggity.yaml` should look something like this:
```yaml
registry:
  uri: "diggity.jfrog.io"
  username: "diggity@carbonetes.com"
  password: "<token>"
  token: ""
 ```
## Attestation
Diggity is integrated with [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/), which allows you to sign and verify SBOM attestations on images you own. To run attestations, make sure to install Cosign on your machine. Then, generate your cosign key-pair associated with a password using the following command:

```
cosign generate-key-pair
```

This should generate the **cosign.key** and **cosign.pub** files. Specify their respective paths and password in your `.diggity.yaml` config file:

```yaml
attestation:
  key: path/to/cosign.key
  pub: path/to/cosign.pub
  password: "<password>"
```

Alternatively, you could specify the information using flags.

|     Flag      |               Description                |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| `-k, --key` | Path to cosign.key used for the SBOM Attestation. |
| `-p, --pub` | Path to cosign.pub used for the SBOM Attestation.       |
| `--password` | Password for the generated cosign key-pair.          |

To run an attestation, make sure that your registry is logged into your machine. Run the following command:

```
diggity attest <image>
```

The attestation metadata can be saved to a file using:

```
diggity attest <image> -f <filename>
```

You can also pass in an already generated SBOM file using the **predicate** flag:

```
diggity attest <image> --predicate <path/to/bom_file>
```

## SLSA Provenance
Include provenance metadata to your SBOMs to provide an additional level of assurance about the secure process used
to build the software. To reference your provenance file, run the following command: 

```
diggity <image> -o json --provenance <path/to/provenance_file>
```

You can also include your provenance metadata in SBOM attestations using the following command:

```
 diggity attest <image> --provenance <path/to/provenance_file>
```
